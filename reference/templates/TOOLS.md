# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## Shad - Memory Retrieval Sidecar

**When to use:** Semantic search across the vault — finding past work, decisions, context when you don't know which file it's in.

**Why:** Keeps your session context lean. Shad does retrieval + synthesis in isolated calls, only the answer comes back.

```bash
# Fast recall (6-12s) - use for most memory lookups
~/.shad/bin/shad run "query" --vault ~/workspace --no-code-mode -O sonnet

# Quick search (raw results, no synthesis)
~/.shad/bin/shad search "query" --vault ~/workspace

# Full research (minutes) - complex synthesis tasks
~/.shad/bin/shad run "task" --vault ~/workspace -O opus -W sonnet -L sonnet

# BM25 search (fast, no embeddings needed) - use when vector search fails
qmd search "query" --collection workspace --limit 10
```

**When NOT to use Shad:**

- Current conversation context (you already have it)
- Simple file reads (just use `read` tool)
- Tasks needing your full toolkit (browser, messages, cron)

## Direct File Access (Preferred for Known Files)

**Use direct `read` when you know which file you need:**

| Task            | Approach                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Today's notes   | `read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`     |
| Your identity   | `read memory/identity-full.md`  |
| User's profile  | `read memory/user-profile.md`   |
| Workspace rules | `read memory/workspace-guide.md`|
| Specific topic  | `read memory/<topic>.md`        |

**Use Shad when:**

- You don't know which file has the info
- Searching across many files
- Need semantic matching (not just keywords)

---

## Memory Storage Workflow

**After writing new memories** (to `memory/*.md`), index them:

```bash
qmd update --collection workspace
```

This indexes new/changed files so Shad (and BM25 search) can find them immediately.

**Memory file conventions:**

- `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — daily notes
- `memory/identity-full.md` — who you are (rich detail)
- `memory/workspace-guide.md` — operating rules
- `memory/<topic>.md` — structured topic files as needed

---

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Vault paths and QMD collection names
- Anything environment-specific

---

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
